# Al-based-tool-for-preliminary-diagnosis-of-Dermatological-manifestations

Introduction:
Skin diseases affect millions of people worldwide and can have a significant impact on their quality of life. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases are crucial for effective treatment and management. Machine learning techniques, particularly image classification models, offer promising solutions for automating the diagnosis process.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a skin disease classification system that can accurately identify various skin diseases from images. The system will aid healthcare professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the DERMNET dataset, obtained from Kaggle. It contains images of various skin diseases, clinically approved and labeled by dermatologists. The dataset comprises images representing 23 different classes of skin diseases.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Before model development, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. The EDA involved analyzing the distribution of classes, examining sample images, and assessing data quality. It revealed class imbalances and provided valuable insights for preprocessing and model development.

Model Development:
Two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures were explored for skin disease classification: VGG16 and InceptionResNetV2. These pre-trained models were fine-tuned on the DERMNET dataset to adapt them to the task of skin disease classification.

    VGG16 Model:
        The VGG16 model was initialized with pre-trained ImageNet weights and fine-tuned on the DERMNET dataset.
        Custom dense layers were added on top of the VGG16 base to perform classification.
        The model was compiled with the RMSprop optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
        Training was conducted using a batch size of 32 and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

    InceptionResNetV2 Model:
        The InceptionResNetV2 architecture was employed as the base model for skin disease classification.
        Global average pooling and dense layers were added to the InceptionResNetV2 base for classification.
        The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
        Training utilized a batch size of 32 and included early stopping for regularization.

Data Preprocessing:
Preprocessing steps were applied to the images before feeding them into the models. These steps included resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the training data to improve model generalization.

Model Evaluation:
Both the VGG16 and InceptionResNetV2 models were evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices were generated to visualize model performance across different classes.

Results:
The performance of the models varied based on architecture and dataset characteristics. The InceptionResNetV2 model demonstrated superior accuracy, achieving around 90% accuracy after reducing the dataset classes to nine. In contrast, the VGG16 model, trained on the original 23-class dataset, achieved approximately 40% accuracy.

Conclusion:
The skin disease classification project highlights the potential of machine learning in automating medical diagnosis tasks. By leveraging deep learning models and clinically curated datasets, accurate and efficient skin disease classification systems can be developed. The project underscores the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation for achieving optimal performance in medical image classification tasks.

Future Work:
Future work may involve further fine-tuning of the models, exploring ensemble techniques, and incorporating additional datasets for training. Additionally, deploying the trained models as web applications or mobile apps could enhance accessibility and usability in clinical settings.
